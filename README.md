## Hi there 👋 I'm Yamuna Yadav Seetha
I'm an Electronics and Communication Engineering (ECE) graduate passionate about VLSI backend flow, RTL-to-GDSII implementation, and hardware design.
Welcome to my GitHub profile!

**About me**

🔭 Seeking opportunities in Physical Design / VLSI / RTL-to-GDSII flows.  

🌱 Currently exploring advanced topics in floorplanning, CTS, STA, and timing closure.  

💼 Hands-on experience with several projects, including:

- RTL → GDSII Flow (28nm): Complete RTL-to-GDSII implementation including floorplanning, CTS, routing, and timing closure.  
- Logic Synthesis Projects: Optimized RTL designs for timing, area, and power using Genus.
